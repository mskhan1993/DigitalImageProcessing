# DigitalImageProcessing

For this Project , aim was to display images and bring in variation to the images
ImageProcess has pictures which has been manipulated and displayed based on preset code.
Hence greyScale , Negative and also basic color like Red only, Green only and Blue only were also displayed. 
Something to focus on was whats happens when one color in a pixel is replaced by other . Hence further code was done where
red replaced green and blue , followed by Blue replaced green and red and then green replaced blue and red.



TryOut

The class TryOut gives user option to input how they want the picture to be displayed . It gives the user flexibility, so different options 
can be choosen to display the picture. 



*** Please Run ImageProcess seperately to get the preset coded picture and then Run TryOut.java to get however you want the picture to be.
